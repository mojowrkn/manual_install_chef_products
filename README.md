# Manual install of Chef products

Here are the instructions for manually installing Chef products. The aim is to enable engineers to do custom installs or installs which don't require nodes to have direct internet access.

* Manual install for [Chef Server](./manual_install/chef_server.md) and its addons (pushy, reporting, manage)
* Manual install for [Supermarket Server](./manual_install/supermarket_server.md)
* Manual install for [Delivery Server](./manual_install/delivery_server.md)
* Manual install for [Delivery Build Nodes](./manual_install/delivery_build_nodes.md)

The install documents are stored in the ```manual_install``` directory of this repo.
